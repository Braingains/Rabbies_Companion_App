We've been tasked by Rabbie's Tours inc to build an app for tour guides on the road to share info and tips with one another.
This will use the Google Maps api and allow users to add and edit pins on the map for points of interest such as toilets, photostops, parking, cafes, attractions, detours, road closures etc. The kind of info tour guides need to know.
These pins can be catagorised and filtered by type/tour/author so the user can more easily see relevant info. These pins can have information strings attached for opening hours etc.

MVP:

	- Be able to load and view a map
	- to add a pin to the map and save it on a db
	- To edit/delete a pin
	- To view all/filter pins by category
	- Populate the map with initial data
	- Colour-code tags
	- CSS

Extensions:

	- Be able to catagorise pins by route/tour
	- Create designs for custom pins
	- Extend the functionality outside of Scotland
	- Have the app automatically find the user's current location.
	- Be able to rate pins with stars etc
	- Track which users contribute most/have a league table
	- Be able to save photos to the DB, have the pics be clickable to show where to get that pic
	- Have a route selector and show the driving route on the map
	- Have an alternate route/detour function.
	- Search for nearest pins
	- Fancy CSS
	
	

Advanced Extensions:

	- Really fancy CSS
  	- Convert it for React Native
	- Have user login/authentication
	- Litter tracking for Mac
	- Track user's GPS routes
	- Specific functionality for user types - e.g Guide/Ops
	- Integrate it into Rabbies' systems

Reminder: do not deploy app with API key. Use key management system.
